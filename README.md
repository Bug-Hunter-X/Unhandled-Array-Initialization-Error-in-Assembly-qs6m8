# Unhandled Array Initialization Error in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a potential error in an assembly program that calculates the sum of elements in a word array. The program assumes that the array is correctly initialized; however, it doesn't handle potential errors such as an uninitialized or incorrectly sized array. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug Description
The assembly code calculates the sum of elements in a word array. It uses the `loop` instruction, which iterates a number of times based on the calculated array length.  If the array is not properly initialized or its size is incorrect, the code may access memory outside the allocated array bounds, resulting in undefined behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves adding checks to ensure that the array is properly initialized and that its size is valid before attempting to process it. The program should also include error handling in case of an uninitialized or incorrectly sized array.
